# Pocket Tagger

A tool that tags your [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) articles with how
long it should take to read them, such as `2min`, `5min`, `10min`, etc.

An avarage adult reads at 250 words per minute so that's the default,
although you can configure this how you like.

## TODO

- Automatic tagging
- Add possibility to remove existing tags
